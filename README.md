# dogbot-site

Hello everyone! This is the website for my Dog Bot. I don't host the bot *all* the time, but it will be up for most of the day. (When I wake up to when I go to bed or when I'm making changes to the bot.)
Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1007807076044636280&permissions=277025516544&scope=bot) to add this bot to your server.

Type in chat: `dog help` to see commands.
