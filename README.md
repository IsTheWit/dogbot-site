# dogbot-site

Hello everyone! This is the website for my Dog Bot. ~~I don't host the bot *all* the time, but it will be up for most of the day. (When I wake up to when I go to bed or when I'm making changes to the bot.)~~ I host the bot whenever.
Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1007807076044636280&permissions=139589970944&scope=bot) to add this bot to your server.

The source code is linked [here](https://github.com/IsTheWit/dog-bot-opensrc) (FINALLY PUBLIC!!!!!!!!!!).

Type in chat: `dog help` to see commands.

Made with code (and some love of course) by [IsTheWit](https://github.com/IsTheWit) and [A1Asriel](https://github.com/A1Asriel)
